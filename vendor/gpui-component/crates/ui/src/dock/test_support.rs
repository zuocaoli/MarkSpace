//! Panel doubles shared by the skin's tests.
//!
//! This lives beside the production modules rather than inside one module's
//! `mod tests` because the same double is needed by two of them: a tab group
//! and a tiles canvas each hand a panel to a different frame, and the question
//! — did the panel get a height? — is the same. Mirrors
//! `gpui_base::dock::test_support`.
