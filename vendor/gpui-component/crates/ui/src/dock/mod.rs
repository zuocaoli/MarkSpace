//! The gpui-component appearance for the dock.
//!
//! The layout tree, the persisted schema, the drag geometry, the active-panel
//! state machine and the container entities all live in
//! [`gpui_base::dock`]. This module is the skin over them: it re-exports the
//! types a consumer needs, adds the presentation half of the panel traits
//! (see [`panel`]), and implements base's three renderer traits.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let area = cx.new(|cx| {
//!     DockArea::new("main", Some(1), window, cx).with_renderer(DockSkin::new(cx))
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! A [`DockArea`] built without [`DockSkin`] still docks, drags and persists —
//! it simply draws no chrome at all.
